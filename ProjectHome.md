I have released a very basic setup of tpl-engine, you can see some documentation about tpl-engine [here](http://code.google.com/p/js-tpl-engine/wiki/HowToUsev01).

Notice how this whole site is basically modeled off of http://code.google.com/p/tpl-engine/ Because this is basically a port of that to Javascript. And the creator of that agreed to let me copy the documentation.
